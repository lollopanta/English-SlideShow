# Web Project Explanation

## Introduction

This web project uses FullPage.js to create a full-screen navigation experience, divided into sections and slides. It also includes a firefly animation that is dynamically generated in each section.

## Project Structure

### HTML

The HTML file is organized into multiple sections (`.section`), each containing informational text and images. Some sections also include slides (`.slide`), managed by FullPage.js for horizontal scrolling.

### CSS

The project uses three main CSS files:

- `fullpage.css`: handles the styling for FullPage.js  
- `index.css`: contains custom styles for layout, text, and images  
- `fireflies.css`: defines the animations for the fireflies in the background of the sections

### JavaScript

The JavaScript code has several key functions:

1. **Dynamic firefly generation**: a `for` loop is used to create and add `.firefly` elements to each `.section`.  
2. **FullPage.js initialization**: FullPage.js is activated with options for automatic scrolling and anchor navigation.  
3. **Adding new fireflies to each loaded section**: using the `afterLoad` callback, the code dynamically adds new fireflies to the currently viewed section.  
4. **Removing links from the page**: a block of code selects all `<a>` tags and removes them from the DOM.
